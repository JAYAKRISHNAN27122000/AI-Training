# Creating Virtual Environment
`virtualenv` is a tool in Python that creates isolated environments for projects. It allows one to manage project-specific dependencies without affecting the system-wide Python installation. Each virtual environment has its own Python interpreter and libraries, making it easy to maintain different package versions for different projects.

` virtualenv ` can be installed in ubuntu by executing following commands:

```
sudo apt install virtualenv
```
## Python Installation
Now post-installing virtualenv, one needs to install python 3.x by executing below commands.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3.9 python3.9-distutils
```
Now verify the installation:
```
python3.9 --version
```
install pip:
```
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3.9 get-pip.py
pip --version
```
## Virtual Environment Creation
Post installing `` virtualenv `` and `` Python 3.x ``, we can easily create a virtual environment as follows:
```
virtualenv --python=python3.9 environments/venv
```
for activating ``virtualenv`` execute
```
source environments\venv\bin\activate
```
## Installing Jupyter Server
After activating virtualenv, one could recognise that by 
```
(venv) ubuntu@rbg-rtx-3060-3:~$ python3.9 --version
Python 3.9.20
```
``(venv)`` suggests the virtual environment named **venv** has been activated.

**Install Jupyter in the virtual environment**:
```
pip install jupyter
```
**Add the virtual environment to Jupyter as a kernel**:
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name='myenv'
```
